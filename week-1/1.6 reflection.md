6. This lesson made me feel a little more comfortable with Git and Github. I had some problems with lesson 1.5, but this lesson helped solidify my knowledge of the command line. I still cant say I am %100 with git and Github, but I think I have made some progress. I struggled with pushing my content back to Github, but I think my confidence will grow with practice.

7. I Didn't use any outside sources to help me with this lesson.
