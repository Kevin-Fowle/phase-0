# H1 1.1 Think About Time

I decided to learn about mediation and habits. I have tried meditation a few times, but it was difficult to develop the habit of meditating daily. Reading articles on meditation has altered the way I view its importance. It can have a profound impact on how the brain functions.  During phase 0 I will use timeboxing to manage my time, and increase my mental health. I am the type of person who wants to work on something until it is done. I often times will exhaust myself and become frustrated or anxious. Learning about timeboxing has changed the way I view productivity. One of my biggest faults is not including breaks into my time management. After reading a few of the articles(and watching some of the videos) I have realized the importance of breaks. My time boxing plan is as follows (Work: 1hr - Break 10min). The ten minute break will allow my brain to better grasp the information that is being thrown at it.  My goal during phase 0 is to completely change how I work. I want to include mental breaks, meditation and time boxing. I also want to start working on my physical health.  Going to the gym was very helpful mentally, but for some reason I stopped going. I am excited to see what phase 0 brings. I am also very interested to see how changing my work habits impacts my work product.



# H1 1.2 The Command Line

When I first saw how long the video was, I honestly thought I was going to be bored. I actually found myself super engaged, and time flew by. I even got caught up a few times trying to write things down. At some points the content was a little over my head. I decided to push through and figure it out later. This strategy ended up being very beneficial to my learning.

A shell is a command-line where users can input commands directly to the computer, instead of using a GUI. Bash is the command language that you use in the shell. It was created by Brian Fox in 1989.

Some of the commands towards the end got a little "involved". The commands that utilized the <, > , | were a little confusing at first. After using them a few times, I started to understand what they did, and how you could use them. This guide did a great job of making you use the commands repeatedly. This really helped me understand the concepts better.

It took a little longer than I would have liked, but I was eventually able to use all of the commands. I also printed out a list of the commands and stuck them on the mirror in my bathroom (lol).

I think the cd, ls, mv, touch, mkdir, rmdir and rm are the most important. To me, these seem like the most used commands during my learning of the material.

-pwd = This command will print the working directory. It shows you which directory you are in, and the parent directories.

-ls = ls will list the everything that is in a particular directory.

-mv = This will move a file or directory to a new location.

-cd = This command will changed the directory you are in.

-../ = This command will move the user up one directory. For example, if I type cd ../ I will move to the parent directory of the folder I am in.

-touch = Touch will make a new file.

-mkdir = This will make a new directory.

-less = Unix uses the less command to view a file. Less also allows you to page through a particular text file.

-rmdir = rmdir will delete a particular directory. This command alone will not remove the directory if it it still has contents in it.

-rm = This command will remove any type of file. It can be a text file, directory or a video and it will be removed.

-help = Help will give you a list of what the commands do. If you cannot remember the syntax of a command it can be very helpful(hehe).



# H1 1.4 Forking and Cloning

Creating a new repository is done through GitHub. You log on your profile and click the plus sign at the top right of the page. Then you click create new repository. Forking a repository is as simple as finding a repository and clicking the fork near the top right corner. Cloning a repo is done on through your terminal. Cd to whatever directory you want to store it in and type git clone. After you fork a repo, there will be a link URL on the right hand side of your screen. Copy the url and then past it after you typed in "git clone" on your command line. You can fork a repository that is not your own so you can play around on it without disturbing the original code.

Surprisingly, I didn't struggle with this assignment. The video was super helpful for me. I find I learn best when I watch someone do it and then I trying copying what they do. I followed step-by-step with the video for the cloning the first repo. When I copied the phase 0 repo, I had no troubles doing it on my own.
