- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was really fun. It was nice to see some of the things i've been learning come to life on the internet. My pair and I worked really well together and we collaborated nicely.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I needed to go to google a few times to remember what needed to be typed in. A good amount of this information is new to me, so I had a little information overload. This pair programming helped me out a lot. It helps me remember certain elements of the curriculum I wouldn't have remembered otherwise.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

The website was basic enough to where no real formatting was needed. It felt a little bland, so I felt like it needed sprucing up, but the directions said to hold off until next week =)

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

One of the things I like about HTML is that you can visualize your progress. It's nice to type something in and see what you have done. I'm the type of person that like to see how far I have come from where I started. So hopefully in a few months I'll be able to see some real progress in my HTML coding skills. HTML can be a little tedious at times. Typing out all of the little pieces of code can drag on a bit, but i'm not trying to complain. I actually love doing it (lol)

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

As of right now, I have been learning by repetition. The more I do these lessons - the better I am getting at remembering the exact syntax. I have needed to go to google a few times, but I think learning by repetition has been very powerful for me.
