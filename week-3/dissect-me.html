  <h2>Week-1 blog post</h2>
  <section>This week had its ups and downs. The beginning of the week went by very smoothly. I was flying through the lessons and learning a lot. My first major roadblock was on lesson 1.5. I had initially setup the virtual machine on the gaming desktop I built about two months ago. I started running into more and more problems on the command line. After a few hours of trying to troubleshoot, I decided I would start fresh on my Macbook. Things picked back up again, but then I made a real rookie mistake. I ran git init on users/user_name/. It took some outside help to assist me in realizing my mistake. Whenever I would run git status my whole computer would show up (Desktop, Documents , ect.). The funny part is, I ended up learning way more about git in my failures.

<section>Version control, while a little intimidating to learn about, plays a crucial role in the life of a developer. One of the analogies I liked best came from one of the videos we were assigned to watch. It was talking about how people worked before version control. Satirically, it gave the example of a bunch of people sitting around a table passing around a thumb drive. Version control allows people to pull some code from the master (main) source, work on it and push it back up to the master. All of this can be done by multiple people without disrupting the original code...brilliant.

<section>       GitHub is a great place to store your code because it has a verity of helpful features. You can view other people's repositories, pull the code down to your local machine, work on it and push it back up to assist them with their work. GitHub also has a very large community of people who log in daily. This means that you can get more eyes on your code to help you become a better developer, and who knows, you might be able to help some others along the way.

One of the tags I continue to use is the section tag. I have used it for my blog posts and I keep on using it. After learning a touch of css (while not using html5) I can really see how helpful some of these tags are. Over the past few days, I have gotten much more comfortable using html and I want to continue learning more tags!

The browser reads the page from the top down. It will read a tag and then look to see if it has any children tags within it. If the tag doesn't have any child tag, the browser will work its way down to the next tag.

The snippets command is soooo cool. Sublime seems to have a lot of functions built into it. Now I don't have to type out all of the starting HTML tags out anymore. It also does a great job finishing my CSS styling tags which is nice.
