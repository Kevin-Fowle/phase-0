// 1. I think it was interesting reading up on the history behind Javascript and its uses. It took a little bit of googling, but I found it to be really intriguing. I wanted to do some searching around about ECMAScript and Netscape. Some really cool stuff here.

// Im a little nervous to start up with a different language. I was just starting to become comfortable with ruby, so this is a little stressful for me. Though, I am excited to learn some new material.



// 2. All of the arithmetic operators are identical. Multiplication, addition, devision and subtraction all use the same signs in both languages. The also share some of the same comparison operators. Some of the differences between the two languages are that Javascript uses type coercion to automatically alter the value you give it. With this difference, Javascript also has comparison operators like !== to tell the program to not use any type coercion.



// 3.  An expression is what comes after the = sign when defining a variable. So If I defined a variable kevin and set it equal to 5+5..the 5+5 would be the expression.

// Semicolons tells the program that the line is the end of a statement. If a semicolon is not placed after the end of a line, it will assume that all the subsequent lines of code after are apart of the same statement. You dont NEED a semicolon after every line, but the program will run differently if you don't put them there.

// Undefined occurs if you ask for the value of an empty variable. You are asking the program to try and grab something that does not exist.

// Console.log visibly prints something to the console. Ruby's print seems to be a similar command. They both allow the user to print a variable, string, intiger ect.

// A while loop will preform an action WHILE the constraints that you set remain true. A for loop requires a variable to be set and it allows you to repeatedly run some code until an expression you specify returns false.

// I think one of the things I notice is that most of the operations are similar, but the way you achieve them is a little different. Ruby has the exact same types of loops, but the syntax is a little different. There are a good amount of subtle differences, but based on this chapter both languages have their similarities. To me it's kinda like Spanish and Italian. Both languages are similar, but subtly different.



// 4. A global variable is any variable that is defined outside of a function. If a variable is defined outside of a function, it is visible to the whole program and is therefore, global. If a local variable(which is defined inside of a function) takes the same name as a global variable. The local variable can be assigned a different value. Local variables are defined within a function, and their scope is only within that function.

// Functions are names for a particular piece of a program. If you need to continually need your input to be values and the output to be under a certain constraint, you should probably use a function.

// A function declaration tells the program that what you are about to do will go in the program as a function. Instead of using var kevin = function we could just use function kevin. It's just a shorthand way of telling the program that kevin is now going to be a function.



// 5. Value.x is used when you are applying a valid variable to the value. An example would be value.length. You are trying to the the length of the value. If you use bracket notation, you are trying to grab a specific value. Value[1] would bring out the second value in an array.

// The objects in Javascript are exactly like Hashes in ruby!



// A lot of the wording in Ruby translates over to JavaScript. The iterators, if else statements, comparison tools ect. are all almost identical. The only difference is some of the syntax or formatting that needs to be done when using them.

// I think JavaScript looks a little more involved, so looking back at ruby it definitely looks a little cleaner. JavaScript is cool and all, but Ruby is looking better and better as I progressed through some of these releases.

// I'm a little nervous after all of this. It's a little bit of an unknown for me, but I think i'll be okay. After working with Ruby for the past few weeks, I think a lot of the skills/though process will translate over nicely.
