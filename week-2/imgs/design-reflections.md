1. The six phases in web design are information gathering, planning, design, development, testing and delivery and maintenance.

2. The design of my blog is meant to be informational. The information should be tendered to people who are new to technology and it should be very easy to navigate. My site will feature pictures, blog posts, contact data, social media links and much more.

3. My target audience will be a few different groups of people. My cohort mates, friends and family will all be accessing my website. This target audience will most likely come for the content of my blog posts. They will want updates on my status, information on what I'm learning and to visualize my progress through viewing my website.

4. The first action I want users to take is to scroll down to view my blog posts. If these are the meat and potatoes of my content, it should be where I want the majority of my viewers to go first. The next action they should take is clicking the links to view/follow me on my social media pages. The final action they might take is to personally contact me through email or other means.

5. A good user experience team can be very beneficial to a web development project. Most people just think about the programmers that are actually building the website, but there are people that need to visually plan it out to optimize it for the best experience. Some people might say that a user experience team is not necessary and that they are too removed from the website building process. It might be true that they are not actively building the website, but planning a website with the user in mind can be very helpful.

6. User experience is valuable because the internet needs to be easy to navigate. Some website are hard to maneuver around and it can be frustrating for users to find the exact data they are seeking. If a user has a tough time navigating a website, it might impact their view of the company.

7. If I have to be honest, I didn't find much of this exercise tedious. As a marketing major, I enjoy learning about how users interact with sites in different ways. I always found it fascinating to get in the mind of your target market and think about what they need from your product and how you can supply it.
