Chrome Dev tools let's you play around with your code to see if it plays out like it should. It's nice because you can use trial and error a whole lot fast than typing stuff in and checking it manually.

You can resize elements by going into the styles tab and adjusting some of the numerical values for the various div elements on your page.


static: This one is a little hard to put into words, but it leaves the element on the document as it should be (no formatting at all)

Relative: This positioning is even harder for me to describe. It means that the elements positioning is relative to itself. Meaning that no formatting you do it will effect it's place on the page.

Absolute: Absolute allow you to put an element anywhere on the page. This positioning allows you to use all of the positioning attributes like top,left,right, and bottom to position the element.

Fixed: a Fixed element will stay locked in its current position. Even when you scroll, the element will stay in place

I liked using the absolute formatting. For me, it was the easiest to work with, allowed a lot of customizability and was the first element I fully understood during this exercise. The most difficult was defiantly the static. It wasn't hard to use, but I was a little confused for when you would use it, or why?

The margin is a transparent box that sits around the outside of an element. A border goes around the content and the padding. The padding clears an area around the content.

This was one of the most frustrating/confusing assignments for me. It was really fun to learn what each element did, but it was frustrating to get a box to do exactly what you want it to do. When you finally got it; it was really rewarding to see the box move across the screen. Overall, the content was a little much, but I learn A LOT.
