# Define a Hash
# A hash is a group of keys with associated values. It is similar to an array, but arrays use numbers to index their data. A hash allows you to set your own index to associate to a value.
# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].


# Your Solution Below
my_info = {}

my_info[:first_name] = "Kevin"
my_info[:last_name] = "Fowle"
my_info[:hometown] = "Des Planes"
my_info[:age] = 22
