# I worked on this challenge [by myself].
# This challenge took me [1] hours.


# Pseudocode



# Initial Solution


# def super_fizzbuzz(array)
#   array.map do |i|
#     if i % 15 == 0
#       i = "FizzBuzz"

#     elsif i % 5 == 0
#       i = "Buzz"

#     elsif i % 3 == 0
#       i = "Fizz"
#   else
#     i = i
# end
# end
# end



# Refactored Solution

# Reflection

# To be honest, I didn't learn anything new. This was a great refresher! It took me longer than it should have, but I was able to get back into the ruby mindset with relative ease. The syntax was much easier to work with compared to Javascript. It is starting to become clear why DBC starts us out with ruby.

# I still feel like I overcomplicate the problem. I think I have the right ideas, but I confuse myself by making things more difficult. Going back and working with Ruby was a nice changeup and it helped me remember some of the things I had learned a few weeks ago.

# I want to get back to reading some more programming books. I take the train to work, so for a while I would read the assigned books. I stopped doing that, and I shouldn't have. I should start reading more because it is just another way I can improve my programming skills.
