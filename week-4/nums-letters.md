puts is a ruby command that when used will print the text on the next line. Print will put the text on the same line. Puts moves it the next line down.

An integer is simply just a number. A float is a more precise number when dealing with decimal places.

Integer devision is dividing two whole numbers like 4/2. Which will output 2. 4.0/2 will equal 2.0. The second example is float devision. It gives a more precise number on your devision. It often will come into play when dealing with decimals.

Strings are pieces of text in ruby. You might need to push some information to the user after they interact with your program. If you were to make a string like "thank you" and then puts that string to the console, the user would be able to read "thank-you".

Local variables allow programmers to save integers or strings to a value. When you need to use the integer or string later on, you can recall the string/integer by calling the variable.

It was a great review of the basics. To be honest, I haven't touched Ruby since the application. It was nice to have a little refresher.
